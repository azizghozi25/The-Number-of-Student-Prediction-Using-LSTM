# The-Number-of-Student-Prediction-Using-LSTM
This project contain about prediction junior high school students in Gunung Sugih, Lampung Tengah using LSTM. Why did I try to use LSTM than other methods? I thought LSTM is deep learning that can record time series well than RNN. But in fact, i have just realized that this case is not required LSTM which is complex method. So I am open to discussion about solving this prediction problem with various possible methods.
